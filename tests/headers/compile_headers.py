#
# Little helper program to test that header files are stand-alone compilable (and therefore don't depend on
# other headers being included first).
#
# Usage: compile_headers.py directory compiler [compiler_flags]
#
# The directory specifies the location of the header files. All files in that directory ending in .h (but not
# in subdirectories) are tested.
#
# The compiler argument specifies the compiler to use (such as "gcc"), and the compiler_flags argument (which
# must be a single string argument, not a bunch of separate strings) specifies any additional flags, such
# as "-I -g". The flags need not include "-c".
#
# For each header file in the specified directory, the script create a corresponding .cpp that includes the
# header file. The .cpp file is created in the current directory (which isn't necessarily the same one as
# the directory the header files are in). The script runs the compiler on the generated .cpp file and, if the
# compiler returns non-zero exit status, it prints a message (on stdout) reporting the failure.
#
# The script does not stop if a file fails to compile. If all source files compile successfully, no output (other
# than the output from the compiler) is written, and the exit status is zero. If one or more files do not compile,
# or there are any other errors, such as not being able to open a file, exit status is non-zero.
#
# Messages about files that fail to compile are written to stdout. Message about other problems, such as non-existent
# files and the like, are written to stderr.
#
# The compiler's output goes to whatever stream the compiler writes to and is left alone.
